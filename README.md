# WPF Dictionary
Welcome to the Dictionary App repository! This is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application developed in C# using the MVVM design pattern that functions as an explanatory dictionary. The application consists of three main modules:

1. **Administrative Module**: Allows users to add, modify, and delete words in the dictionary. Each word has a description, a category, and an optional image. Words are stored in a XML file, and categories are managed dynamically.
2. **Word Search Module**: Enables users to search for words within specific categories or across all categories. The search functionality includes autocomplete for word suggestions and displays word details such as description, category, and image.
3. **Entertainment Module**: Features a game where users have to guess five words from the dictionary. Each word is accompanied by either its description or image, randomly selected. Users can click "Next" or "Previous" to navigate between words, and after guessing all five words, their score is displayed.
